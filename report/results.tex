The Euler method does not pass the tests for conservation of kinetic energy, potential energy and angular momentum for $\Delta t = 0.002$\ref{â€¢}

\subsubsection{Escape velocity}\label{results:escape-velocity}
Using the model for the two-body system, a trial and error process of finding the escape velocity
for a planet with initial position 1AU away from the sun was performed. The calculations were
performed using the velocity Verlet method. \ref{fig:escape-no} shows the non-escape case, while
\ref{fig:escape-yes} shows the escaping case.

the planet has $v_{init} = 8.6\tfrac{AU}{yr}$}

\subsection{Three-body system}
Simulating the three body system in which Jupiter acts on earth. The effects of another massive object is explored by adding substantial mass to jupiter to see it's effect on earths trajectory.
