\section{Method}

\subsection{Unit tests}
Unit tests are implemented to check that the numerical solutions are stable. More precisely, it is tested that the kinetic energy, potential energy and angular momentum all are conserved in the motion of the particles in the system. See section \ref{sec:cons} for justification that these should be conserved.
