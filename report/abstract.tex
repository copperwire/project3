\section{Abstract}
In this project, the second-order differential equation describing Newtons law of gravity has been
solved using forward Euler and velocity Verlet methods. The solutions were used to simulate the
solar system including all planets. Through comparisons of stability and computation time,
the velocity Verlet method was found to be the best choice for the simulations. The simulations are
first presented as a two-body problem, then expanded to accomodate any number of objects as an
N-body problem solver.
