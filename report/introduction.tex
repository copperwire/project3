\section{Introduction}
In this project the goal is to develop a code for simulating the motion of objects in the 
Solar System, using the velocity Verlet algorithm. 
The Verlet algorithm will be compared to the well-known forward-Euler 
algorithm for the initial parts of the project.  
To generalize and simplify the structure of the program, 
the code will be object oriented, so repeatable parts and operations are written as classes.
The project will progress by first developing a code for the two-body Earth-Sun system, and then
expanding to a three-body system, before finally completing the solar system with all planets.
The implementation of the algorithms will be tested by making checks for the conservation of 
energies and angular momentum. Initial conditions for the objects in the solar system are
found on NASA's web-pages \footnote{http://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/horizons.cgi}.
\newline
As a base for classes and the general structure of the program, the example code available
\href{https://github.com/andeplane/solar-system}{here (Github)} was used.
